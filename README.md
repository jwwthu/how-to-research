*Comment: Highly Recommneded. Practical Formula with Annotated Examples*

* [General Tips](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/general-tips/)
* [Abstract](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-abstract/)
    > - General and Specific Background (~1 sentence each). Introduce the area of science that you will be speaking about and the state of knowledge in that area. Start broad in the general background, then narrow in on the relevant topic that will be pursued in the paper. If you use jargon, be sure to very briefly define it.
    > - Knowledge Gap (~1 sentence). Now that you’ve stated what is already known, state what is not known. What specific question is your work attempting to answer?
    > - “Here we show…” (~1 sentence). State your general experimental approach and the answer to the question which you just posed in the “Knowledge Gap” section.
    > - Experimental Approach & Results (~1-3 sentences). Provide a high-level description of your most important methods and results. How did you get to the conclusion that you stated in the “Here we show…” section?
    > - Implications (~1 sentence). Describe how your findings influence our understanding of the relevant field and/or their implications for future studies.
* [Introduction](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-introduction/)
    > - General Background. Introduce the general area of science in which your project takes place, highlighting the status of our understanding of that system.
    > - Specific Background. Narrow down to the sub-area that your paper will be addressing, and again highlight the extent of our understanding in this sub-area.
    > - Knowledge Gap. After discussing what we know, articulate what we do not know, specifically focusing on the question that has motivated your work.
    > - “Here we show…” Very briefly summarize your methods and findings.
* [Methods](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-methods/)
    > - State the reasons for choosing your methodology
    > - Use subheadings to organize content
    > - Provide minimal essential detail
    > - Avoid “we did…” or “the authors did…”
* [Discussion](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-discussion/)
    > - Tell how your paper is special
    > - Relate your results to existing results
    > - Tell how your study’s limitations leave open the big questions
* [Results](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/journal-article-results/)
    > - Create a logical narrative, organized into subsections
    > - Each Results paragraph has rationale, data, and a transition
    > - Show minimal essential data
    > - Use appropriate style

> + Question (1 sentence): What was the goal of your study? State your hypothesis or question clearly and succinctly.
> + Results (4-5 sentences): I generally aim to sum up each figure or section of the paper in one sentence of the abstract.
> + Conclusions (1-2 sentences): Sum up very quickly why your results are important by tying them back in to the issue you mentioned in the introductory sentence.

> This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you turn your high-quality data into a high-quality manuscript for publication in a scientific journal. It covers all aspects of the writing process, including: choosing a journal to which to submit your paper, writing each section, formulating your “story,” making figures, soliciting constructive criticism, and navigating the review process.

#### [How to get your research published-Journal of Organics](https://philpapers.org/rec/PAUHTG)
> Make it easy to say 'yes'. The first rule to get your research published is to make life easy for the editor and the reviewers. The task for an author is ultimately a narrative task - to succinctly and engagingly tell the story of what you did, why you did it, what you found, and why we should care - and making it clear why the paper is within the scope of the journal. The more carefully and meticulously a paper is prepared - including spelling, punctuation, grammar, structure, completeness and internal consistency - the more likely it is to be published and the quicker it will appear in print.

#### [Writing a literature review-Catherine L Winchester and Mark Salji](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2051415816650133)
> Formal literature reviews are a critical appraisal of a subject and are not only an academic requirement but essential when planning a research project and for placing research findings into context. Understanding the landscape in which you are working will enable you to make a valuable contribution to your field. Writing a literature review requires a range of skills to gather, sort, evaluate and summarise peer-reviewed published data into a relevant and informative unbiased narrative. Digital access to research papers, academic texts, review articles, reference databases and public data sets are all sources of information that are available to enrich your review.

#### [How to Write a Literature Review Paper?-Transport Reviews](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1065456)
> This paper discusses the question about how to write a literature review paper (LRP). It stresses the primary importance of adding value, rather than only providing an overview, and it then discusses some of the reasons for (or not) actually writing an LRP, including issues relating to the nature and scope of the paper. It also presents different types of LRPs, advises on reporting the methodology used for the selection of papers for review, and the structure of an LRP. An important conclusion is that the heterogeneity in LRPs is very large. This paper also presents some of the aspects that the authors feel are important structural and contextual considerations that help produce high-quality review papers.

### Computer Science Case
#### [INFORMS Journal on Data Science (IJDS) Editorial #1: What Is an IJDS Paper?](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ijds.2020.003)
> An IJDS paper will have four ingredients, data + methodology + decisions + implications, but the key is the synthesis of the ingredients, anchored to methodology. Here is one potential approach for such synthesis that will be familiar to many in our community:
>> Fired by a managerial/industrial decision-making motivation and potential/actual impact, the paper introduces aninnovative data sciencemethodology (model/algorithm/ approach), applies it to data (real-world and/or simulated) to illustrate its usefulness and behavior, and considers practical (e.g., computation, implementation) and ethical (e.g., societal, environmental) implications.

#### IEEE Author Biography Guide
> Each author may include a photo and biography in their article, although photos and biographies are often omitted from conference-related articles. Follow these tips for writing your biography.
>> + If you are an IEEE member, list your status and the corresponding year in parentheses immediately after your name; for example, (M'01-SM'05-F'15) denotes that you became an IEEE Member (M) in 2001, a Senior Member (SM) in 2005, and a Fellow (F) in 2015.
>> + The first paragraph may contain your place and/or date of birth, followed by your educational background. Degrees should be listed with the type of degree in what field, which institutions, city, state, and country, and the year the degree was earned. Your major field of study should be in the lower-case.
>> + The second paragraph lists military and work experience, with job titles capitalized. Include a location for your current job. List no more than three published books or articles. Include a list of current and previous research interests. In the second paragraph, use the appropriate pronoun and not your last name.
>> + The third paragraph begins with your title and last name (e.g., Dr. Smith, Prof. Chen) and lists any memberships in professional societies other than IEEE. List any awards and work for IEEE committees and publications.
>> + If you choose to include a photo, it should be a professional, high-quality headshot. Note that while photos are optional, if they are included, they will be published.
>> + Remember, biographies and photos cannot be edited or removed after article publication.
